# About

**React Native** project developed as one of the challenges during my **Ignite bootcamp** with [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/).

- This app provides a list of exercises per body area, and each exercise suggests the number and 
**series** and **repetitions**. 
- Furthermore, you can mark the exercise as **completed** which creates your exercises **history**.
- On the **History** page it displays the exercises per day in a **Section List**.  
- On the **Profile** page you can set a **profile picture** by uploading it from your device.
- You can only access the exercises if you are **authenticated** (App routes/private), otherwise you are displayed with the **SignIn** or **SignUp** pages (Auth routes /public).



 # Motivation


- Practice ***React Navigation v6*** (***Stack Navigation and BottomTab Navigation*** were used)
- Learn and practice styling with **Native Base** 
- Practice **AsyncStorage** to store user, token and refresh_token.

- Interact with the Dev Community, learn together and progress as a Developer.
- Keep committed with my goals.</br>
